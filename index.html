                        through
                        visual storytelling is what drives my enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>In addition to design, my curiosity extends to the dynamic field of web development. I explore
                        the
                        intricacies of HTML and CSS, enhancing my skills with the use of Dreamweaver. This hands-on
                        experience allows me to create not just functional but aesthetically pleasing websites.</p>
